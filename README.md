We all know have to take the specifications of some components (including relays) sourced from the Far East with a pinch of salt sometimes. My 10 Amp mains relay seems to be somewhat underspecified.  

Not only that, the spark from the relay every time I switch my power off could rival some firework displays. This I had to sort out with the standard RC (resistor/capacitor) "snubber" circuit - I found a decent set from China but was it any good?  

So I had to replace a relay, add a snubber circuit and learn a painful lesson that even small "toy" kits from China can have a bit of a sting in their tails. Ouch. And don't laugh, it hurt!  

So my eventual solution was fairly straightforward, but there is a better way, which I mention at the end of the video - something for a future project, perhaps, now that the price of the magic component is low enough.
